The feeling of leaving her alone behind simply terrified me, I wouldn't leave her for nothing in the world. I was already planning to train her to the leash and get her used to it, now I will surely do it. I'm in Italy and I really hope, for the sake of us people and our furry friends, that this shitty situation ends, that Ukrainian people get to live their lives in their country in peace as soon as possible, and that this madness doesn't spread further in Europe bringing unnecessary destruction and death.

Your lady is a beauty."

Putin was smart though, he pulled the safety pin on the world's most dangerous grenade and now we're all too scared to call the bluff. (If it even is a bluff)

I am not religious, so I cannot say I am praying for you but I hope that you, your family and the entirety of Ukraine prevail and if you don't that you live knowing you spent your time as a conscious being enjoying all that you could. 

Life is beautiful, even in these dark times - and this beautiful fur baby is proof of that. ♥️"

257,Dear-Tomato8984,Compare this Chad cat to the Canadian cats in Ottawa who couldn't handle some honking without shitting themselves.
258,LyftIsnotokayanymore,"Poor baby. I’d check for extra shedding. She’s probably terrified and on high alert, even if she’s handling it well. 

I hope Putin gets pulls his ass out of Ukraine or gets fucked so bad he has no ass left to pull out of Ukraine. Seriously. Stupid reason to murder people and the propaganda is ridiculous too. Trying to frame like Ukraine is full of nazis? They clearly took cues from the left’s tactics in USA and some European countries. If they want to villainize something they just call it nazi until it’s so associated with the concept that the thing itself gets used similarly. Don’t agree with them about something? Nazi! Or ‘right wing’ ‘far right’ etc. The right has caught on too so some of them do the same thing. As a centrist it’s tiring. 

There is a limit though… and someone needs to tell this large man child that the price of him putting his hand in the forbidden cookie jar is far too high for what little reward he is hoping to gain. Sometimes the jar is worth more than the cookie and ruining the rest of the cookies in the jar for a single cookie is stupid.

Did he think Ukraine would just bow down because he was killing them? Like wtf. He’s been a dictator able to threaten and beat people into submission for too long. He doesn’t understand it’s not normal!

Maybe he doesn’t understand that because they know this they fight harder not to be under his tyrannical thumb. 

I don’t know how someone gets that drunk on power but this is stupid and childish but very much on adult world leader scale and thus has a much higher cost. A cost that cannot be justified by whatever stupid petty crap he is up to.

I just know please make sure that sweet baby is staying hydrated. Cats don’t do well with dehydration. The nose is a good way to tell. If it’s dry kitty is dehydrated."

293,synesthesiatic,"You're a very good soul. Both of you please stay safe - this storm is absolutely not to be fucked with.

I'm sure you already know this - but make sure you've got your power banks charged, all your chargers, important papers and meds ready to go in a backpack if you need to evacuate suddenly. Generally speaking you'll want two shirts, two pairs of pants, and a week's worth of underwear and socks. Snacks, wet wipes and painkillers are gonna be essential. Headphones/earbuds, in case you're caught in a shelter with no privacy or quiet for awhile. Important papers, chargers and stuff go in a waterproof / ziplock bag and stay in the inmost pocket of your belongings. A multitool or small pocketknife and a ballpoint pen are useful things to keep around as well.

Do not keep your wallet in your back pocket, it may get wet or stolen. Put it inside your bag with the other important stuff. If you've got time, withdraw some cash as well. I usually carry about $120 for food and sundries, but I know this isn't possible for some folks, so whatever you can safely withdraw. Put some in your wallet, and some in a hidden / inner pocket in your bag.

Something I also did in the past was to take pictures of my ID, passport and other important stuff (medication bottles/prescriptions), and then upload them to a private Google Drive folder so I always had them with me if I had access to a computer or a phone.

Please be safe, and good luck. <3

EDIT: One last thing. Keep a pair of closed-toe, slip-on shoes and socks by your bed. If there's a tornado in the area, and gods forbid your house gets hit, you are going to 100% want shoes.

EDIT 2: Thank you for the awards. I forgot to add that you can line your backpack with a black plastic garbage bag, and keep your clothing in gallon ziplocks - I do this when I fly as well. Stay safe, everyone. <3"

My town suffered a Cat 5 hurricane on October 10th, 2018 and life has not been the same for me. Get as much gas, water and non-perishables as you can. Buy those big jugs of water for bathing. Put your valuables in the safest part of your house, including your computer. You won't regret. Stay safe 💖"

583,eggsssssssss,"Thanks. It’s obvious there’s no justification for the Russian invasion, but this post still bothers me. Straight-up, it’s lazy propaganda. The Russian state doesn’t have anything to do with the fact that circulating stuff like this is unhealthy and uninformed. But it feels good to boost online to people watching the news, so here it is.

Happens just as often on reddit with terrorist orgs, police departments, militaries that aren’t currently facing down a war of aggression from one of the great powers, etc."

She had already mentioned that her post had been removed 3 times on other subs and she was hoping that on that one (where I saw the post) they wouldn't take it down. But I had already found it very odd, in the photo the woman looks genuinely happy, heavily made up and, besides, why would you take your pet to war? Glad to see the photo is old"

The US is a party to these treaties. That’s why I was a bit confused with the “controversy” at the southern border. It should have been a non issue. The only “issue” was with people from Guatemala, Honduras, etc. My understanding of the terms of these treaties is that you are supposed to stop once you reach safety. In the case of people fleeing violence in Central America, that would be Mexico not the United States. Not saying it’s right just saying that’s what the agreements say to my understanding."

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону.  Ми готові до вашого приїзду.  На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

РЕДАКТИРОВАТИ: ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНА ВІЗА ДЛЯ ПРОЙДЖЕННЯ ПОЛЬСЬКИМ КОРДОНОМ.  ВСЕ, що ВАМ ПОТРІБНО, - це ПАСПОРТ.  ВІЗИ ПРИСПИНЕНО!  ВОНИ ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНИ НА ЧАС!!!!!!

Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

as a proof that you no longer need visa:

921,Fourseventy,"So I bought this little keychain stuffed Totoro one day as a lark from one of those coin operated vending machines like an oversized gumball machine but for toys.  

It turned out my cat absolutely loved it. He carried it with him everywhere and loved to play fetch with it. He played with it so much it started to get a hole in it and the stitching wasn't the greatest.  I figured I would go back to the mall where I bought it and would get another. Well... stupid me... of course they rotate whatever random toys are in there so I couldn't get him another. 

The only place I could find to actually buy them was through aliexpress and the minimum order was 50.  So I ordered my little boy 50 of them. I also bought a couple plush cat bus's for good measure as well. 

The little Totoro toys arrived six weeks later and watching my cats eyes when I opened up a box of 50 little totoro toys was priceless. 

He now carries the little Totoro plush toys from downstairs to up to our bedroom every night while singing the song of his people.  I love it. 

Also having 50 little Totoro's stashed and hidden around my place makes me a little happy inside.

Edit: Obligatory woah this blew up! Thanks for the Gold & Silver kinds strangers.

961,datacollect_ct,"That's awesome.

When I got my kitten all my socks started vanishing.

I figured out there was a small hole in my box spring mattress one day when I couldn't find him.

I ripped it open bigger and looked in with a flashlight and he was like a little sock dragon sitting on his treasure.

There was a neat if like 20 socks he had stolen away in there."

I did see some inspiring news that many countries accepting Ukrainian refugees are waiving the usual paperwork/licensing required when bringing in animals. Hope it's true."
1266,cidvard,I was really surprised how much my kitty - who hated her cage-like carrier - responded to a backpack.
1267,YippieKayYayMF,"This is making me reflect too. I'm not even close to this type of conflict, but I have three cats and only one carrier (I take them to their check ups in turns).

Time to buy more and prepare for something that would likely never happen!"
1268,whosethisrandombitch,">I did see some inspiring news that many countries accepting Ukrainian refugees are waiving the usual paperwork/licensing required when bringing in animals. Hope it's true.

To add to this, there is a Facebook page called [Georgians for Ukraine ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/320194396794418/?ref=share), where people in geoegia are offering asylum to Ukrainians/offering recourses. There are 3.3k people in the group, and it is post after post of people offering up their house to host people.

Edit- it's up to 4.6k now.


Also, yeah currently kind of in this situation of being unprepared for an emergency. Living in georgia (the country) and shits getting pretty real here. A lot of people are getting very nervous that georgia will be next. It's 4am here and I am trying to make back up plans on how I'm going to get me and my kitty out of here.

I'm not completely unprepared, I have a cat carrier and he has a passport showing he is vaccinated and neutered, but oof, does this make me wish I had bought the backpack for cats when I saw one at the zoommart a few weeks ago."
1269,cocolocoweed,"I was given advice once from a cat sitter that, in the event of an emergency, you can use pillowcases to put your cats in to get them out in a pinch if you don’t have access to a carrier/backpack!"
1270,BareKnuckleKitty,"Wow, you're right. Your comment convinced me to seriously look into getting one. Thank you for posting this. I've never even considered that. I live in an earthquake prone area and need to be more prepared."
1271,why0me,"Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

EDIT2: as a proof that you no longer need visa:

• ⁠in Ukrainian https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua • ⁠in English https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en"
1272,Q_Fandango,"I crossed the US/Canadian border on foot (the border was closed for the pandemic, but I had to get to an American family member in an emergency) with my cat in the Astronaut bag.

He screamed the whole way and the border agents thought I had explosives strapped to me, but we survived the trip.  10/10 would catnap him again.

Here’s my boy [screaming in front of a witch house](https://imgur.com/a/iyf2FlX) in Salem, Mass. on the way down south."
1273,redheadfreaq,I can confirm. There is also a widespread action to find temporary homes for the pets of the people who can't stay with them in the places they found shelter in.
1274,notnaxcat,"We got one after an drill earthquake evacuation, i was prepared, was going to happen at a fixed Time and my husband was at work so I wanted to check how much Time would take me to get our cat in the Carrier, put the emergency backpack and go down 3 floors...just 3 floors, i tought pretty easy, boy, i was naive. The hardest part was the bulky Carrier, so I got the biggest pet backpack i could on Amazon immediately. It really helped was big, as last year we had a real earthquake, while we werent at home and my sil was catsitting our, now, two cats, and she got them in the same backpack. 

My heart hurts and I hope they stay safe in this horrid times."
1275,MyOther_UN_is_Clever,">I saw another pic of this man earlier and it convinced me to get a backpack carrier.

My sister has a backpack carrier, and that's a good idea.  There are so many disasters that can happen outside of war, too, that it'd be a good idea to have it for.  You never need it until you do, and then it's too late to get one.

Make sure you leave it out and put treats and stuff in there for them so they associate it as a good, safe place."
1276,OatmilkMatcha333,Honestly been thinking about this. I want to prepare an emergency bag for my cat.
1277,OneMorePenguin,I have four cats.  I should purchase a wagon or other form of wheeled cat vehicle.  I do have a carrier for each of them in case of disaster.
1278,Drink-my-koolaid,I found a [cat emergency evac kit and carrier.](https://www.chewy.com/pet-evac-pak-ultimate-cat-pak-pet/dp/353723?utm_source=partnerize&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_campaign=1100l22691&utm_content=1011l30087&clickref=1101liRiJDDu&utm_term=1101liRiJDDu) It even has a collapsible litter box! They have evac kits for dogs too.
1279,FF_01_1999_03_05_01,There was a video of a lady floating around that had nothing with her besides a gym bag and a pet carrier with her cats. It was heartbreaking
1280,doktornein,"Make sure to get a soft version. The plastic ones are impractical and heat up dramatically. Ever since I had a plastic traditional carrier drop the bottom on me I exclusively use soft carriers. Plus the cats literally choose to lay in them like beds when they are just set out, so they must be more comfortable!"
1281,xilentmetal,I got a cat backpack off Amazon when my building had multiple fire drills and I had trouble carrying 40lbs of cat carriers down 4 flights of stairs. Now I put my chonker in the backpack and just carry a lighter carrier down instead.
1282,ChinaLovesYouToo222,"Interesting to actually think about.

Almost spring cleaning time, people should do just cause clean your home.

But should add into it, safety cleaning.

When is the last time you looked at your fire extinguisher? What is that?! If fire happens how save cat? Need to have a secret stash of that sound of their favorite treat to get them quick. Ruffle the bag and toss them in there.

Also yea where is the fire extinguisher?"
1283,random-anonymous-me,"Make sure to have printed copies of your vet paperwork,  cat food, blankets, collar and leash, etc 

Preparedness doesn’t end with hoomans"
1284,thatlldo-pig,"Man this seriously scares me as someone with multiple dogs, cats, fish, horses, etc. I have no fucking idea what I would do. I can’t imagine what these poor people are going through"
1285,Speerjagerin,"A fitted harness is also great, especially for squirmy or fearful cats. And you can keep one in the emergency pack."
1286,PipsqueakPilot,"I bought one tonight. The thought of having to just let my cat go and trust he'd do okay is just... Yeah. He's a tough cookie, and would probably do fine. But not a risk I want to ever have to take."
1287,Anniethesnowleopard,"Definitely in Poland lots and lots of people tries to help get all kind of pets to foster homes, and helps with transfering animals from Ukrainians animal shelters, provide food and medical help for them as well"
1288,rouxs7,I invested in one a while back and my anxiety never lets me out it away. It’s always near by in case of an emergency
1289,Kate_Bockroaches,Our kitty likes both the carrier and backpack (luckily) but we typically use the carrier due to how big he is when we have to travel normally.  But the backpack is 100% for emergencies (living on the gulf coast - never know during hurricane season) and we want to be prepared.
1290,SweetlyConceited12,"Good call. I got one when I was taking my older kitty to NYC since I figured it would be easier to transport her (it was) but now that I have twice I’m not sure if both cats would fit in it? I can’t carry two backpacks so I’m not sure what to do…

Obviously I’m so privileged to be far away from a conflict like this. But I do routinely have nightmares about trying to flee with my cats."
1291,woa12,"Oh man, I didn't even know these were a thing lmao.

I only have a carrier for my cat that'll have to literally lug him around in, in case there's like an emergency."
1292,mermaidboots,This. My carrier is an airline approved soft sided crossbody one. My cat won’t like it but she’d be safe if something like this ever happened where I live.
1293,worrier_princess,I'm definitely going to look into getting one too. I've had to prepare to evacuate because of bushfires before and a backpack carrier would definitely make things easier in the worst case scenario.
1294,coolcoolcool485,I have one and I really like it. I want to get a nicer one just because I'm paranoid about how great the zipper may be in a crisis. It hasn't given me any problems lol it was just one of the cheaper ones and im...very paranoid lol
1295,tightheadband,I have 2 backpack carriers for my two cats. I really hope my SO will be with me in case of an emergency because otherwise I don't know how I would carry both backpacks and my baby altogether. :( At least here in Canada the chances of being in a war are very slim.
1296,Ok-Metal-6281,I have a soft carrier (basically cat luggage) but one of those bubble dome backpacks might not be a bad thing to have if I needed to get out of here with the quickness.
1297,EarorForofor,Ok but fr what is the strongest bag? My biggest one is 25 lbs and easily fits in a toddler's carrier. We have a soft side dog carrier but I'm not sure if it would make it through a disaster
1298,UndeniablyPink,"Not only that, but do some practice runs with the cat in there. I’m sure you’re on it but cats are weird and it will only make it better if the cat is already used to being in the backpack if there’s an emergency."
1299,americonium,https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua
1300,Kelacia,Wow. I’ve never thought of this until now. I will be buying one for each of my cats today. Thanks for the idea!
1301,iambluewonder,Do it. I found one on Amazon that I've used for about 3 years in now and it's really comfortable for me and my cats
1302,CaribouHoe,I live in Vancouver and in fear of The Big One and you make a great point... I just bought a cat backpack.

We keep the bulky ones in our storage unit down the hall from our apartment, and I was so nervous if anything happened I wouldn’t be able to get to it and would have to use a pillowcase or something. I keep them under the bed and pray I never have to use them but I’m glad they’re there. So worth it

1305,siilkysoft,"ordering one now. <3 I have a little cat emergency pack at the front door that I refresh every so often (small box of litter, bag of food, etc) and it's got a carry case and a leash. I constantly think about that, and remind my husband if anything happens this pack is here etc, but a backpack is such suchhh a good idea. hopefully we never have to do that. I hope this man and his kitty are safe. It's stressful seeing him hold her in his bare arms, no leash. <3"
1306,Burntoastedbutter,I have a bubble luggage and backpack carrier for my cat. She loves it. Soon I'll be harness training her for the outside.
1307,victoriafalyce,Imagine how many pets have been left behind amidst the evacuation… breaks my heart to think of them in their empty homes listening to bombs dropping.
1308,durmiendoenelparque,"They said in my local newspaper that many bomb shelters don't allow people to bring their animals. I understand why but it's heartbreaking, yeah"
1309,wandahickey,There was a woman on another thread who said she was not going to leave if she couldn’t take her cats.  My heart broke for her.
1310,musicman835,I think of all the animals after Chernobyl too. I mean the scene in the HBO series where they go door to door killing animals makes me so sad.
1311,MrsSalmalin,"Oh my fick that is so heartbreaking. I can't imagine having to leave my baby (cat). I would do everything I could to keep him with me, but that's not always possible :("
1312,PineappleT,In addition to the toll on humans this is what also kills me inside. All those poor pets 😢 I gave my cat an extra hug today as we thought of people and pets in the Ukraine
1313,Baradarm,"I had watched a documentary on Chernobyl's wildlife yesterday. The star of the documentary was a mumma cat that had got her kittens into a safe place before the winter and left them on their own.
I know it's silly, but when I heard Russia had begun it's invasion, I thought at least those cats would be safe. Apparently Russia is now fighting in Chernobyl. Damn

Praise this lad for taking care of his cat."
1314,MourkaCat,"I think being Slavic (Or at least Ukrainian/Russian) just is in your blood to be a cat person. 
I've seen so many people who have their kitties in carriers and are fleeing with their cats. 
It's earth shatteringly hard to see, those poor little babies. I imagine my own scardey cat in this situation, he would be so so afraid. I am thankful he is safe in my home, but my heart just aches for the wildlife and pets and strays and animals...."
1315,pupshep,What's the name of the documentary? Sounds interesting
1316,brencoop,This is breaking my heart.

During a tornado here- we get a lot of them- my Siamese boy, basically disappeared. We freaked out looking for him. When the tornado passed here comes my boy out from under a big oak table and under things under the table. He knew what to do. This is all terrible. God watch over Ukraine and all creatures great and small."
1362,Maggiejaysimpson,"This reminded me of when we had a fire in our house and my oldest kitty girl went missing and we couldn’t find her before we had to get out of the house. Luckily, our garage burned down and that was it. When we went back in the house I opened our sliding glass door and she was hiding outside on our deck.

(Like Scottish fold, etc, with the folded ears) There's a video showing the front of kitty with this man who is lovingly stroking and holding him very close while kitty pants from stress. His ears are just folded, he is one of those breeds.

But the panting is a dead giveaway that he is clearly very stressed. I'm glad he isn't freaking out and trying to escape the man's arms in a panic. He feels safe with his human, despite the stress."

This is the the most searing image that makes me feel all the suffering and misery this ""initiative"" will cause. 

Adults, children, beloved pets. All of them already have a lifetime burden on their shoulders. Even if by some miracle they will shortly be able to get back to daily life (I know that's not going to happen), these poor people will be in trauma the rest of their lives.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

1540,THRlLL-HO,Cat helping his man*
1541,RevengeCorgi,"Honestly, I can't explain how sweet and painful it is to see this. The cat clearly loves their dad and the cat was the important thing he took with him to shelter. From the picture, the cat looks like it's loving on their dad for comfort. I live in an area of natural disasters, and I go by the rule: Never more cats than you have arms for this exact reason. 

People should never have to be in this kind of fear from other people. Unrealistic of me, I know, but it's how I feel. These people shouldn't have to be holed up in the metro and dreading an attack. It has to be stopped by the people who have the power to do so."
1542,FuchYuTu,The cat is protecting his man.
1543,Grimmisgod123,well now I’m thinking about the poor cats and dogs who are ALSO caught up in this BS.

Checked to see what was inside and it was this little guy. Good thing we worked today because we usually don’t work on Sundays and I don’t think she would have lived. She is just as sweet as she can be, I don’t understand people.

Update : My father is keeping the cat. Thank you to everyone reaching out about taking it. It will live a healthy life at his home."

1555,Chairs_Are_People,"Why would anybody do this??? Just bring an animal to a shelter if you can’t handle it. Or, honestly, just let the cat flee. They would have a better chance of surviving wandering alone than in a bag in a dumpster."

1559,R00t240,I’ll never understand why people tie animals up and throw them in the trash. Besides the obvious being a sociopathic sadist and getting off from harming something if that’s not the case why not just let it go outside. What’s the thought process?

1569,,"My cousin works in a senior living facility in Accounting. One of the patients died, and had a sweet little dog. My cousin said to leave it in the woods and drive off….she has a 1 year old btw.

I was pretty disgusted with her but not surprised considering her personality. Her friend took the pup in. It’s name is Ethel and she’s a tiny Yorkie only 5 pounds! But so sweet."
1570,IreallEwannasay,"I got my cat because this lady got her daughter a kitten. The step-dad was allergic and just let her loose one day. I know because when we tried to return her because she was chipped and all, they said no. They had a puppy, now and the girl had bonded to it. I said eff it and took her home. She was so tiny and surviving on the streets. I still call her street cat but she's also Bubbles, now. Anyway, the cruelty somebpeople show to cats is so gross. I don't understand why it's so accepted, either."

1572,ShaidarHaran2,"Who are all these psychopaths' that tie them up in garbage bags like that?! Even letting them go gives them a chance, but really, many adoption services have free dropoffs with no questions asked for this very reason. A friend actually had their clinic broken into, window shattered, for someone to leave a box of kittens inside in the winter...Even that was a fair sight better than tying them up in a garbage bag to starve to death!"
1573,ThrowAwayTheBS122132,What the fuck is wrong with some people? I’m so glad he’s out of there and safe now

1580,OpinionBearSF,"> What the fuck is wrong with some people? I’m so glad he’s out of there and safe now

Sadly, it seems to be common with humans to devalue life, whether that life is baby cats or human babies. Both (and more) have been found in dumpsters.

People can be cruel,heartless, and evil beyond description.

Generally speaking, people fucking suck.

The occasional individual person is a kind soul."
1581,JosephSperry1,Can you pull up any footage nearby? I’d love you get his license and get him thrown in jail(I wish I could do more…)!
1582,,Some people are terrible and have no souls. Disgusting.
1583,SparkyLyl,This is definitely somewhere in Trump Country.
1584,PDX_Web,I think one might actually need to be a psychopath to dispose of a cat that way.
1585,di_treecity,God bless OP but seriously fuck the people who dumped him
1586,BeesToTheFace,"Not saying this did happen, but sometimes cats get into trash cans, now I imagine an elderly person not realizing it was in there and taking the trash out. Then wondering where the cat went. However this doesn’t work if it was just the cat in the bag."
1587,,Seriously. I'd happily go to jail for assault over someone doing something like that. Why do some humans have to be such trash?
1588,,"People who do cruel , unimaginable things to animals should be skinned alive!!"
1589,Fuckyourfeeling5,"Oh the cat… I thought it was the fingernail, iPhone mannequin.

my bad, carry on"
1590,dgollas,You should see how 99% of animal products come from.
1591,iWentRogue,"This is anecdotal but i once found a kitty inside the dumpster; inside a trash bag. My though process was “what kind of POS did this, obviously opened the bag to get it out. 

Got curious and kept looking over the bag and found a ripped hole on the underside. Turns out the little rascal was a stray and ripped his way into the bag looking for food.

Not saying this is what happened in Op’s case but strays always dumpster dive for food."

1598,LimaBeansAreGood,"I will never, ever understand the concept of abandoning and killing animals. It infuriates me beyond reason. 

Thanks for saving the fur baby!"
1599,JoJack82,"Right?! There are so many ways to get rid of an unwanted animal that don’t involve murdering it.  And if the shitheads want to make it easy on themselves, put it in a cardboard box and leave it out front of a shelter.  Still a dick move but it’s the same amount of effort as murdering it without having to be a complete piece of human garbage."
1600,Agent-Asbestos,People get in a twist about the death penalty but animal abusers deserve it.
1601,fpcane305,Whoever put that creature in the trash can burn in hell. Hopefully sooner than later.
1602,llLoWangll,Maybe put them in the trash bag and let them rot in the dumpster.
1603,Podju,"Sadly we don't know hell exists, so to be sure they suffer, torture them while they are still alive."
1604,LurkerPatrol,Both the cat and the person will get what's coming to them. The former will get love the latter will get all the crap.
1605,FelverFelv,I legit teared up because it looks just like one of my kitties
1606,Competitive_Sign_149,she’s so pretty and sweet looking. i hope she finds a good home
1607,zack1567,I will make sure she does. It will have to be someone I trust or else I’ll just keep it.
1608,FairyRogue,Our two youngest cats were tossed from a moving vehicle into our driveway at 3am. They were 2weeks old at best. One suffered brain damage and is slightly weird but a sweetie. His brother is fine. Both are now 8months old and thriving. Donkey the one with the brain trauma does have seizures sometimes. His meds and frequent vet appointments keep him stable.

1620,_Nilbog_Milk_,"I get bad anxiety when I start thinking in thought loops of all the terrible things folks do to animals and eachother, and how there's many of these bag cases that never have a person to save them.

Take your baby to the vet and get it checked out for any residual issues. To this day my Billy cannot be around plastic bags or tall, skinny, men with silver gray hair. He still suffers from sever PTSD. Just be gentle and kind. Let your baby learn that it can trust you. Food will help. Thank you so much for rescuing this sweet baby."
1641,Zoso1973,I just can’t comprehend how someone could do that to an animal. Such a little beauty. You could put a gun to my head and try to force me and I still would never be able to put an animal in a bag and leave it to die.

1706,shockedpikachu123,There’s the option to go to a shelter or even worse (but better than trash) is just to let the cat out. To throw it in a trash bag is so awful and heartless
1707,Rubyowen1969,"Most humans are completely despicable. I had a similar situation about 6 weeks ago. I discovered a cat in a trash can, but she was in there looking for food. She was very thin and weak. I took her home, only to discover she was pregnant, too!  The vet offered to go ahead and spay her, but I didn't do it because she was so far along. I had an ultrasound done and she was only carrying one kitten.  That kitten was born a week later, the day before my birthday, and mom and baby are doing great.  Of course, I plan to get them both spayed.  I'm so glad you saved that little one!"

I miss that dainty, dryer sheet smelling princess ❤"
1721,moosecatoe,"She found the right home!! If you have any questions, feel free to contact me any time. (Of course contact your local vet if its an emergency). I have a PreVet and Animal Bioscience BS, worked as a vet tech for 10 years. I was going to go to vet school, but my health condition had another idea. Now I get my kitty-fix by fostering, volunteering at adoption events & catch/release events, & helping with shelters surgeries. So I love when people pick my brain for feline knowledge. I gotta use it somewhere!!! 

Any questions from food, poops (runny, stinky, constipated), pee pee problems, fleas, ringrown, etc, I got you!

Just please take little Sunday to the vet for an exam asap. She looks healthy, but she could have ear mites, fleas, worms, FIV, calicivirus….. some things that could spread to your other animals - or even to you!

Keep her isolated and take note of if shes using the bathroom. Sometimes they need a warm washcloth to stimulate their moms licking down there. I can also give you great tips on the cheapest way to get rid of fleas! Diluted dawn dish soap! Let me know and good luck!!! Sunday found the right home ❤️"

Like, Christ. 

My friend found a cat in the parking lot a few weeks back. We did the sensible thing and dropped the cat off at the local animal shelter. Give the cat a chance to be adopted into a loving home. 

The fucker thought they should just tie a cat inside a bag and leave them in a dumpster with no chance for them to escape.

Jesus. Just let the cat out then. That's a better chance for survival than this sadistic crap."
1733,Just_Hanging_Aroun,Somebody tossed such a sweet beautiful baby? What was it to much effort to just put her up for adoption at a humane society or shelter? Gosh some people.

1735,anawkwardsomeone,"What kind of messed up brain can someone have to do this to a helpless innocent creature like this?

Why kill it in such a slow painful and agonizing way? Why kill it at all? Why harm does this poor creature do? Stuff like this makes me heart a little colder each time.

I truly hope the monster that did this is forced to live a life full of torture, pain and agony. Death is not enough of a punishment.

So thankful that this kitty found you. Please keep it safe. Please make sure it goes to a safe environment if you can’t keep it."

 The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,
It isn't just one of your holiday games;
You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.
First of all, there's the name that the family use daily,
Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James,
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—
All of them sensible everyday names.
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,
Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—
But all of them sensible everyday names.
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular,
A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,
Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,
Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum-
Names that never belong to more than one cat.
But above and beyond there's still one name left over,
And that is the name that you never will guess;
The name that no human research can discover—
But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,
The reason, I tell you, is always the same:
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation
Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:
His ineffable effable
Effanineffable
Deep and inscrutable singular Name."

2175,mycatistheOA,Greyson could be a cute name. He is absolutely adorable. Such a handsome and sweet boy! I reeeaaally see Maine Coon mix here. My boy Monty is a Maine Coon mix and such a good man! He’s really affectionate and always greets me at the door. Happy you two found each other!
2176,Rose_en_Quartz,"My sweet little (big) grey son haha

That’s what everyone keeps saying and I really want to hope! He’s so fluffy and his tail is ridiculously poofy. I never knew maine coons were so affectionate either but he definitely fits the bill. Not like any other cat I’ve met or had!"
2177,lagunat,"He kind of looks like he could be a maine coon! Don't be surprised if he suddenly grows more hair. When I rescued my cat, she was completely short haired except for her tail, and with the proper nutrition and care she became a medium haired cat!!"
2178,Rose_en_Quartz,I actually met his mom in the humane society and she’s short hair so whatever fluff he’s getting is from his papa. His paws are HUGE though so I’m wondering if you’re spot on cause he’s gonna be big.

I broke up with my extremely abusive ex who would never let me get a cat, and a few weeks later I went to the shelter basically out of depression and spite. I'd seen a picture of a scared black cat on the shelter's website and went to the shelter to meet him, but because of covid they just handed him to me and said I couldn't meet him but I could just take him for free. So I brought him home and before and since that day I have never met a cuddlier cat. I'll break up with all my future boyfriends for him.

2461,phulton,"Completely normal. It could mean a few things; they're hungry, trying to make a comfortable bed, or it's a mindless relaxation habit. 

Each one depends on the context. Most likely your cat is hungry. Kittens would knead their mom's teats to get milk to flow and that instinct never really left them. 

Pro tip: DO NOT feed your cat first thing after waking up. They will begin to associate you getting out of bed with getting fed. Your cat absolutely will start waking you up earlier and earlier whenever they get hungry. 

I start the day with my routine; brush my teeth, make coffee, make my food, and then feed my cat. His demeanor changes when I'm wrapping up my meal because he knows he'll get fed soon. He's never pushy about it until he knows I'm almost done and his food is coming soon."
2462,pstryder,"My wife feed the cats in the morning, and complained about them waking us earlier and earlier. I took over feeding and feed them at 8:30 pm. 

Now they come find me and start staring at me at 7:30, and then they all start screaming at me @8.

Still better than them waking us up."
2463,astral_fae,We feed our cats before bed. At around 9:30 the heart breaking cries and the soul piercing stares begin
2464,MaineAnonyMoose,"This ^, OP! Teach your kitty NOW! To avoid sleep struggles. You could associate a task or a sound to breakfast time.

I specifically call my cats' names and say ""breakfast"" after each so they know NOW is breakfast time. Sometimes it is hours after I get up. Sometimes right away. But their food time is mostly consistent while my wake up time fluctuates. They leave me alone until I call them for it now for the most part -- though sometimes the staring can get intense, the begging crying doesn't happen anymore.

Good luck!"

There’s been at least one study done on this by a professor who noticed her cat’s morning purrs were very effective at getting her out of bed in the morning, and found in a study that it actually mimics the frequency...or at least, the pacing (I don’t fully remember) - of a crying baby."
2478,Dag-nabbitt,"I open feed my cats, and they still do this. The reflex likely came from getting milk, but they don't just do this when they're hungry."
2479,ClappedSwede,"The correct fact is that cats do this when they've been separated from their mothers too early, then this behaviour stays with them.

Kittens massage the breasts of their mother to stimulate milk production.

It doesn't mean much in adult years since it's just a force of habit and they enter a kind of trance like state while at it.

But yeah, while they'll kneed soft fabrics, they don't often kneed people they don't trust. :)"

2535,baddabingbaddaboop,Kneading (the thing with the paws) is what kittens do to get milk from their mother. When they grow up it stays in their head as something that shows and reinforces how much they like you 😄 it makes them feel safe and if your cat is doing it to you then they clearly feel safe enough with you to get comfy
2536,Ravenstrike2,It’s called kneading. Kittens do it to “massage” milk out of their mothers. Adult cats tend to do it on people they like.
2537,Im_justtryna_leaf,"Your depressed.he’s trying to CPR you, the only way he knows."

2544,janetplanetzz,"This is their “needing” they did to their mommy to get milk from her when they were babies. It’s their way of saying they trust and LOVE you!  

Fluffy blankets help yet I let my boys do it to me in bed (especially if their nails are not sharp) 
because I know it’s soothing for them too!  

I like it for a few minutes - yet if they did it like a masseuse, up and down my back, I would let them do it for longer!😀. Enjoy the loving!  

If they are trying to wake you up…then try gently pushing them away.  They will get the message after a few times - unless they are stubborn."

2556,Whyitsospicy,He’s making the bread bro. Let him work smh.
2557,RobustNippleMan,Cats do this as a baby on their moms belly when drinking milk. It’s an affection thing. He adores you and knows he’s about to get fed
2558,,Absolutely not. She is trying to probe you to find your weakpoints to eventually destroy you. Be careful!
2559,sifridstatten,"Cats do this to momma cat when they are kittens to get milk; it is nicknamed ""making muffins.""

It means you are ""mom/dad/Person"" OR they are hungry"
2560,ReverendReed,He's just tenderizing his next meal. Nothing strange here.
2561,XZeeR,Since you are a new cat owner here is an info: Cats tend to get active before dawn (so around 3-4 am). Don't be alarmed if the Cat starts darting across the house playing and knocking things over. Do not punish her as well as it's their instinct.
2562,sacboy326,"Yes! The purring is an obvious sign that the cat loves you as most people know, but with the paws, that is what we call “kneading”. Basically, they do that to show that they are comfortable and trust you. It can also help relieve them from stress, but that’s not what this cat is doing, especially with them on top of you or just doing it on your body in general. My cats don’t get on top of me since I’m very sensitive and it hurts when they do, but most of the time they try to do a kneading motion when lying right up next to me even when their paws aren’t up on anything.

Needless to say, you have one happy, caring, and affectionate cat. :)"

Bad news: your abs are soft. Cats like to rumple soft things."

2571,MFTSquirt,Wait! Soon he'll start drooling because he's purring so hard.

2573,dujalcollie,He's kneading your flesh to make sure it's tender so that when the cats destroy humanity you're good to eat

It was pure chaos soft food was every where lol. 

They still lose it everytime but not nearly as much as that first time. My boy cat Bert will also yowl into his food bowl as he's eating if we add chicken broth. It sounds hilarious!"

But my horker figured out that if he waits until my grazer opens hers up first, he can climb over her head or eat from the other side and still have his own food waiting for him. So I had to get a hood for her dish so he couldn’t do that anymore. Most devastating day of his life."
2635,FISHBOT4000,"My 3 cats all eat in separate rooms, but it makes meal time a lot easier. They all come find me usually 30 min or so before meal time and start acting all sweet. When i get up, they've all learned that if they go into their respective rooms when i call them over, they'll get food shortly.

I know who needs to be wrangled first, which order i make meals in, how each one likes their food, and feeding order. We have a whole system worked out."
2636,PhantomFoxx02,"My cats are just like this. One sits patiently and even gives a sweet, thank you meow when served his food. He has to eat locked in another room.

2658,wife20yrs,"I am an in home caregiver and my client’s cat waits for me every morning. When I arrive, I make his “breakfast”: dry food blended with about 1/3 of a can of cat food, plus a little hot water for gravy. I use 2 small food bowls and fill both with 1/4 cup each of dry cat food. I add a few temptations treats to one bowl and while the cat eats that, I mix his wet/dry mixture. He still whines and tries to get it out of my hands as I am mixing it with a spoon. I can’t imagine having more than one crazy kitten to chase me with the cat dishes!"
2659,Manuels-Kitten,My cat loves raw eggs mixed with her food. She devours the whole bowl.

2663,snowfuckerforreal,"One of our cats, O’Malley,  is a terrorist. He will literally knock paintings off walls, books (and anything else he pleases) off the book shelf, glasses off the kitchen counter, all while looking at me with  dead “feed me” eyes. He’s a true asshole but also one of the sweetest most chill cats ever. He’s a bengal so I can’t blame him too much. Still, every morning we’re under siege until he’s fed. He’s currently sitting on top of our bookcase giving me the death stare as I write this."
2664,rizzycant,How many times did it take them to make a mess climbing on the sink counter and spilling everywhere when you first open the door before you realized you needed to grab their bowls?

 [TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8F13tgR/)

Some things about the cats: 

1: They’re not starving. They are just excited, they were eating scraps of garbage months ago.
2: They were feral cats, both rescued personally this summer from the great outdoors!
3: Striped cat is Holly, black cat is Yara.
4: Yara is polydactyl on all 4 paws!!
5: Holly is 7 months old and Yara is 1.5 years old!!
6: Contrary to some of the comments they’re very well behaved and they love humans. They don’t even hide from strangers (friends) when they meet them."
2671,partyon,A firm schedule can combat this behavior too.
2672,OneMorePenguin,"My four are all anxious.  One of my cats, who is not underweight, is very aggressive whenever I have food.  He'll eat spicy food but he doesn't like cantaloupe.  Probably other fruit as well, but i have yet to try :-)

I prep my food on the counter.  They don''t dare get up when I'm around, but I hear the thump when they've been up there when I'm in the other room.

I see that you were prepared for the immediate onslaught of cats.... moving the bowl as far away as possible and immediately grabbing it :-)  What are these purty kitties names?"

You might wonder why. Well, it is really bad for their teeth. Hard cat food gives the cats the opportunity to 'brush' their teeth. While you should still brush your cat's teeth, hard food significantly reduces infections in the mouth."
